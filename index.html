            <p>Hello, I am Liam Wynne and I am trying to be a developer of websites beyond websites, developers GO! (little "Thunder Cats reference"). I currently reside in the Manayunk area of Philadelphia, PA. For years and still, I worked in restaurants started out as a dishwasher and move myself up to management.
        </p>
              <p> My favorite hobbies are listening to music, playing volleyball and darts (don't worry it is not a the same time but would be fun to try it though), recently traveling and experiencing new cultures.
